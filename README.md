# First Challenge at AMDOCS Bootcamp

In this challenge, we developed a basic digital bank that are able to:

* Create an account of two kinds

* Deposit cash

* Witdraw cash

* Tranfer cash in the same bank agency

We use all the features of OOP to complete this challenge. It's super basics and I'll try to improve it latter adding lombok to reduce verbose and try to put it on cloud.
